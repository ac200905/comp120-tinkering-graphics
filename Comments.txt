Functional Coherence - The code works properly without any obvious errors.
Sophistication - the code could be less "duplicated", every unit reskinning has the same loop for "y" and "x".
Maintainability - Some of the comments are getting over 79 character limit. Also the code has obvious duplicates. 
Some of the functions do not fit PEP-8. There are also no doc-strings.
Creative Flair - The code is not quite creative, as the main work is duplicates (only colors are changed).
Use of Version Control - On GitHub the work has been committed only once.

I suggest instead of having multiple functions, have one and pass a parameter of colour, 
it would improve readability. If a new image was decided it would not be able to handle it unless the sprites were the same size, 
I would suggest having some constants.
